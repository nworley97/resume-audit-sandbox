    Walk me through a decision you made with incomplete or conflicting data and explain how you evaluated risk, what assumptions you challenged, and how you knew when to act. Tell me about a time you strongly disagreed with a senior stakeholder and describe how you framed your argument, what you compromised on, and what you would do differently now. Describe a project where success depended on influencing people without authority and explain the specific tactics you used to gain trust and alignment. Give an example of a failure that wasn't obvious at first and explain the early signals you missed, how it compounded over time, and what systems you put in place afterward to prevent recurrence. Explain how you balance speed versus quality when deadlines are unrealistic and resources are limited, and give a concrete example where that tradeoff had real consequences. Describe a time you had to unlearn something that previously made you successful and explain what triggered the realization and how you adapted.
