            "Our biggest challenges were <strong>deeply vetting candidates, validating whether resume claims matched reality, and ensuring candidates were actually focused on our role.</strong>
            Altera didn't change our decisions. It <strong>confirmed them faster and with higher confidence.</strong>
            It helped us avoid wasting time on candidates who looked good on paper but couldn't defend their claims."
